# Saves remaining screen content for the next call.

# Assuming the screen to be partitioned in three areas:
#    output (all but the last two lines)
#    input  (second to last line)
#    status (last line)

# If no output_delim is given, returns as soon as the expected status
# is reached ('expected_status' matches).

# If the status line matches 'buffer_full', clear is called to get a re-draw
# of pending further output, until the status line matches
# 'buffer_ready'.

# Deletes all lines from buffer matching 'delete_lines'.

# Returns stretch from last expect_3270 call up to & including line
# matching 'output_delim' as array of lines.

# Clears buffer history since last expect_3270 call if(clear_buffer)

# Dies when timing out

# potential point for improvement:
