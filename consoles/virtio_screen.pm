=head2 type_string

    type_string($self, $message);

Writes $message to the socket which the guest's terminal is listening on. Unlike
VNC based consoles we just send the bytes making up $message not a series of
keystrokes. This is much faster, but means that special key combinations like
Ctrl-Alt-Del or SysRq may not be possible. However most terminals do support
many escape sequences for scrolling and performing various actions other
than entering text. See ANSI, VT100 and XTERM escape codes.

=head2 read_until

  read_until($self, $match_expression, $timeout, [
                     buffer_size => 4096, record_output => 0, exclude_match => 0,
                     no_regex => 0
  ]);

Monitor the virtio console socket $file_descriptor for a character sequence which matches
$match_expression. Bytes are read from the socket in up to $buffer_size chunks and each chunk is
added to a ring buffer which is also up to $buffer_size long. The regular expression is tested
against the ring buffer after each read operation.

If $record_output is set then all data from the socket is stored in a separate string and returned.
Otherwise just the contents of the ring buffer will be returned. Setting $exclude_match removes the
matched string from the returned string. Data which was received after a matching set of characters
is lost unless data from the socket is being logged to a file.

Setting $no_regex will cause it to do a plain string search using index().

Returns a map reference like { matched => 1, string => 'text from the terminal' } on success
and { matched => 0, string => 'text from the terminal' } on failure.
