Virtio terminal does not support send_key. Use type_string (possibly with an
ANSI/XTERM escape sequence), or switch to a console which sends key presses, not
terminal codes.
FIN.

=head2 send_key

    send_key(key => 'ret');

This is mostly redundant for the time being, use C<type_string> instead. Many testapi
functions use C<send_key('ret')> however so that particular case has been implemented.
In the future this could be extended to provide more key name to terminal code
mappings.

=head2 type_string

    type_string($self, $message, terminate_with => '');

Writes $message to the socket which the guest's terminal is listening on. Unlike
VNC based consoles we just send the bytes making up $message not a series of
keystrokes. This is much faster, but means that special key combinations like
Ctrl-Alt-Del or SysRq[1] may not be possible. However most terminals do support
many escape sequences for scrolling and performing various actions other
than entering text. See C0, C1, ANSI, VT100 and XTERM escape codes.

The optional terminate_with argument can be set to EOT (End Of Transmission),
ETX (End Of Text). Sending EOT should have the same effect as pressing Ctrl-D
and ETX is the same as pressing Ctrl-C on a terminal.

[1] It appears sending 0x0f will press the SysRq key down on hvc based consoles.

=head2 read_until

                     buffer_size => 4096, record_output => 0, exclude_match => 0,
                     no_regex => 0
  ]);

Monitor the virtio console socket $file_descriptor for a character sequence
which matches $pattern. Bytes are read from the socket in up to $buffer_size/2
chunks and each chunk is added to a ring buffer which is $buffer_size
long. The regular expression is tested against the ring buffer after each read
operation. Note, the reason we are using a ring buffer is to avoid matches
failing because the matching text is split between two reads.

If $record_output is set then all data from the socket is stored in a separate
string and returned.  Otherwise just the contents of the ring buffer will be
returned.

Setting $exclude_match removes the matched string from the returned string.

Data which was read after a matching set of characters is saved to a carry
buffer and used in the next call to read_until (unless the console is
reset). If the match fails the whole ring buffer is carried over to the next
call.

Setting $no_regex will cause it to do a plain string search using index().

Returns a map reference like { matched => 1, string => 'text from the terminal' } on success
and { matched => 0, string => 'text from the terminal' } on failure.

=head2 peak

Read and return pending data without consuming it. This is useful if you are
about to destroy the virtio_screen instance, but want to keep any pending
data. However this does not wait for any data in particular so this races with
the backend and data transport. Therefor it should only be used when there is
no information available about what data is expected to be available.
