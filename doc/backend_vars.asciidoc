-------------------------------

.COMMON backend
[grid="rows",format="csv"]
[options="header",cols="^m,^m,^m,v",separator=";"]
|====================
Variable;Values allowed;Default value;Explanation
CASEDIR;string;;Absolute or relative path to the test distribution. Specifying the variable is mandatory. Can also be a Git repository URL of a test distribution to checkout with an optional refspec or Git commit hash into the current directory. It tries to follow the definition of https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/package-json#git-urls-as-dependencies (e.g. `https://github.com/os-autoinst/os-autoinst-distri-opensuse.git#feature/test` or `git@github.com:os-autoinst/os-autoinst-distri-opensuse.git`). Note that cloning via SSH is only possible if Git is configured accordingly on the host where isotovideo is executed. Can be combined with `TEST_GIT_REFSPEC` and `NEEDLES_GIT_REFSPEC`. Relative paths are considered relative to the working directory of `isotovideo`.
PRODUCTDIR;string;;Absolute or relative path to the optional "product directory" which includes the test schedule entry point `main.pm` as well as a `needles` subdirectory with the needles to load. Defaults to `CASEDIR`. Relative paths are considered relative to `CASEDIR`.
NEEDLES_DIR;string;;Absolute or relative path to the needles subdirectory. Defaults to `needles` within `PRODUCTDIR`. Can also be a Git repository URL, comparable to `CASEDIR`. Relative paths are considered relative to the working directory of `isotovideo`.
WHEELS_DIR;string;;Absolute or relative path to the directory wheels are stored in if `CASEDIR` contains a `wheels.yaml`. Defaults to the working directory of `isotovideo`. Relative paths are considered relative to the working directory of `isotovideo`.
INCLUDE_MODULES;string;;comma separated names or fullnames of test modules to be included while excluding all that do not match, e.g. "boot,mod1"
EXCLUDE_MODULES;string;;comma separated names or fullnames of test modules to exclude. Can be combined with INCLUDE_MODULES and has precedence, e.g. to additionally exclude modules based on an include-list
SCHEDULE;string;;comma or space separated list of relative paths to test modules within CASEDIR to be scheduled instead of evaluating a schedule from the test distributions main.pm file, e.g. "boot,console/mod1". Test modules can be specified without the implicit file extension '.pm'.
_EXIT_AFTER_SCHEDULE;boolean;0;Exit test execution immediately after evaluation of the test schedule, e.g. to check only which test modules would be executed
_SKIP_POST_FAIL_HOOKS;boolean;0;Skip the execution of post_fail_hook methods if set. This can be useful to save test execution time during test development when the post_fail_hook is not expected to provide any value as most likely the test developer already knows what needs to be done as a next step on a test fail.
TEST_GIT_REFSPEC;string;;git refspec to checkout within `CASEDIR` when `CASEDIR` is a git working copy. By default, does not change the content of `CASEDIR`. Overrides the optional git refspec in `CASEDIR`. Can be used to explicitly select a git commit within an existing git working copy and also to skip unnecessary git network transfers when `CASEDIR` is already providing the right git working copy.
NEEDLES_GIT_REFSPEC;string;;git refspec to checkout within `NEEDLES_DIR`. See `TEST_GIT_REFSPEC` for details.
EXTERNAL_VIDEO_ENCODER_CMD;string;;Specifies the command line for invoking a custom video encoder. It is supposed to accept a sequence of PPM images via stdin. The placeholder `%OUTPUT_FILE_NAME%` is replaced with the output file path. The output file path is appended if the placeholder is missing. Examples: `ffmpeg -y -hide_banner -nostats -r 24 -f image2pipe -vcodec ppm -i - -pix_fmt yuv420p -c:v libvpx-vp9 -crf 35 -b:v 1500k -cpu-used 1`, `podman run --rm --workdir /pool -i -v .:/pool ghcr.io/tamara-schmitz/ffmpeg-docker-container-free -y -hide_banner -nostats -r 24 -f image2pipe -vcodec ppm -i - -pix_fmt yuv420p -c:v libsvtav1 -preset 10 -crf 35`
EXTERNAL_VIDEO_ENCODER_OUTPUT_FILE_EXTENSION;string;webm;The extension of the output file when `EXTERNAL_VIDEO_ENCODER_CMD` is used.
EXTERNAL_VIDEO_ENCODER_ADDITIONALLY;boolean;0;Whether `EXTERNAL_VIDEO_ENCODER_CMD` should only be invoked additionally to the built-in Theora encoder. This means two videos will be created and uploaded which can be useful for comparison. (Configuring an external video encoder disables the built-in one by default.)
NOVIDEO;boolean;0;Whether the creation of the video should be disabled and also any `EXTERNAL_VIDEO_ENCODER_` variables be ignored.
NO_DEBUG_IO;boolean;0;Disable the I/O debug output in case of needle comparison times longer than expected

_CHKSEL_RATE_HITS;integer;15000;The amount of times, the select should return the same fileno during the _CHKSEL_RATE_WAIT_TIME seconds, to consider the VNC console unresponsive
TIMEOUT_SCALE;integer;1;This scale parameter can be used based on performance of workers to prevent false positive timeouts based on differing worker performance.
PAUSE_AT;string;;Test module (name or fullname) to pause test execution at. To be used together with the openQA developer mode which also allows to continue test execution again. Note that this does not start a developer mode session. So you still need to confirm taking control over the test to access the developer mode controls.
PAUSE_ON_SCREEN_MISMATCH;boolean;0;Pause test execution on the next screen mismatch. Same notes as for `PAUSE_AT` apply.
PAUSE_ON_NEXT_COMMAND;boolean;0;Pause test execution on the next test API command. Same notes as for `PAUSE_AT` apply.
PAUSE_ON_FAILURE;boolean;0;Pause test execution on a test failure (instead of invoking the post-fail hook and terminating). Same notes as for `PAUSE_AT` apply.
_QUIET_SCRIPT_CALLS;boolean;0;Add quiet flag to all the calls to script_run, script_output and validate_script_output. It will omit all the squares "wait_serial expected" on the Details view of the test case. This option might be useful for serial terminal tests.
_WAIT_STILL_SCREEN_ON_HERE_DOC_INPUT;float;0;If this value is greater then 0, it is used by `wait_still_screen` before starting to write the script into the here document used in `testapi::script_output()` function (see: poo#60566). By default this depends on the backend.
AUTOINST_URL_HOSTNAME;string;;hostname or IP address of host running the autoinst webserver endpoint, defaults to the local IP address within the qemu network for the qemu backend or the `WORKER_HOSTNAME` otherwise.
UPLOAD_METER;boolean;0;Display curl progress meter in `upload_logs()` and `upload_assets()` test API functions.
UPLOAD_MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE_GB;integer;0;Specifies the max. upload size in GiB for the test API functions `upload_logs()` and `upload_assets()` and the underlying command server API. Zero denotes infinity.
UPLOAD_INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT;integer;300;Specifies the inactivity timeout in seconds for the test API functions `upload_logs()` and `upload_assets()` and underlying the command server API.
NO_DEPRECATE_BACKEND_$backend;boolean;0;Only warn about deprecated backends instead of aborting
XRES;integer;1024;Resolution of display on x axis. Sets the resolution of the video encoder, and in qemu, the initial console resolution when OFW is set (Power and SPARC), and the EDID resolution for devices that support EDID
YRES;integer;768;Resolution of display on y axis. Sets the resolution of the video encoder, and in qemu, the initial console resolution when OFW is set (Power and SPARC), and the EDID resolution for devices that support EDID
VIDEO_ENCODER_BLOCKING_PIPE;boolean;0;Whether the pipe for writing data to the video encoder should be blocking or not. Making it blocking might allow following the live view in realtime despite large screenshot file sizes but it is not a well tested configuration
DEFAULT_CLICK_SLEEP;float;0.15;Default single click time in seconds
DEFAULT_DCLICK_SLEEP;float;0.10;Default double/triple click time in seconds (both press time and interval between clicks)

If this threshold is reached while server alive messages are being sent, ssh will disconnect from the server, terminating the session.  The server alive mechanism is valuable when the client or server depend on knowing when a connection has become inactive.
_SSH_SERVER_ALIVE_INTERVAL;integer;60;Sets a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has been received from the server, client will send a message through the encrypted channel to request a response from the server.
