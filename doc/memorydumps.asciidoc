= Memory Dumps

In the case that some test are failing under abnormal
circumstances, the os-autoinst api offers the possibility to the tester to save
a memory dump and disk image when certain conditions are met.

IMPORTANT: Currently only the QEMU backend is supported.

== How to use

Three methods are available to the test writer, `freeze_vm`, `save_memory_dump`,
and `save_storage_drives`

The feature is enabled by calling the aforementioned methods, using
a https://github.com/os-autoinst/openQA/blob/master/docs/WritingTests.asciidoc#how-to-write-tests[post_fail_hook] and setting the test's flags as fatal. The `save_memory_dump` method can be however
called at any point within the test.

=== save_memory_dump

The method `save_memory_dump` can be called at any point, but it is recommended
to use it within a post fail hook. Different filenames should be provided if the
dump is being used within the test itself (or more than one memory dump is being
created) if no filename is provided, the test's name will be used.

=== save_storage_drives

The method `save_storage_drives` saves all of the SUT drives using a filename
provided by the user, if not the current test's name will be used  as part of
the final filename, the default will be the current test's name. The  disk
number will be always present.

NOTE: Call this method to ensure memory and disk dump refer to the same machine state.

=== freeze_vm

If it is supported by the backend `freeze_vm` will allow the vm to be
paused/frozen within the test. So that memory and disk dumps can be extracted
without any risk of data changing.

NOTE: Call this method to ensure memory and disk dump refer to the same machine state.

== Examples

A very simple way to use this helpful feature is the following:

[source,perl]
----------------------------------------
sub post_fail_hook {
	my $self = shift;
	freeze_vm;
	save_memory_dump(filename => "my-memory-dump");
	save_storage_drives("my-disk");
}

sub test_flags { return { fatal => 1 } }
----------------------------------------
