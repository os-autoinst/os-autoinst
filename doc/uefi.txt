For testing UEFI boot you need an UEFI firmware which is available in OBS as a
rpm package.

zypper in OVMF

This package contains /usr/share/qemu-ovmf/bios/bios.bin which replaces the
bios /usr/share/qemu-kvm/bios.bin from the kvm package. All the other files in
/usr/share/qemu-kvm/ are still needed.

So prepare a new directory where you create symlinks to all the needed
files. Choose you preferred path instead of /tmp/uefi.

 mkdir /tmp/uefi
 cd /tmp/uefi
 ln -s /usr/share/qemu-kvm/* .
 ln -sf /usr/share/qemu-ovmf/bios/bios.bin .

Now set UEFI=/tmp/uefi in you env.sh and watch your system booting UEFI.
