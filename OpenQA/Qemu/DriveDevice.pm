=head2 OpenQA::Qemu::DriveDevice

The device which the SUT sees. The data on the device depends on the block dev
chain pointed to by 'drive'.

=head3 drive

The 'active layer' block device, that is, the top block device in a block
device chain. It is called 'drive' to reflect QEMU's naming.

=cut
has 'drive';

=head3 model

The type of device QEMU should emulate e.g. scsi-hd. See 'qemu-kvm -device
help'.

=cut
has 'model';

=head3 paths

The connections to this device (multipath). Should be of type
OpenQA::Qemu::DrivePath. If left empty, QEMU will decide what to do.

=cut
has paths => sub { return []; };

=head3 bootindex

The boot priority of this device. Zero has highest priority. Bootindex is not
supported by some firmwares and settings.

=cut
has 'bootindex';

=head3 serial

The serial number of the drive

=cut
has 'serial';
has 'id';
has last_overlay_id => 0;

=head3 num_queues

The number of I/O queues of the drive, esp. for NVMe devices

=cut
