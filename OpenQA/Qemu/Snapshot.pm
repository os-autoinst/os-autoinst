=head2 OpenQA::Qemu::Snapshot

Represents the state of a virtual machine at a particular point in time. Not
much information about the snapshot is stored within this class itself, it is
used mainly as a reference to identify disperate objects as belonging to a
single snapshot.

We only consider snapshots which form a linear chain. Branching snapshots are
not supported.
