=head3 OpenQA::Qemu::PFlashDevice

Some storage devices can only be created using the '-drive' parameter in
QEMU. Pflash is one such device (at the time of writing), so we can not use a
standard drive device to represent it. This limits our control over how the
drive device and block device chain are created; we can not set the node id of
the top block device for example nor can we override the backing file AFAIK.

This class is the same as DriveDevice except for a few extra fields and
gen_cmdline has been overriden to use '-drive' instead.

use Mojo::Base 'OpenQA::Qemu::DriveDevice';

    my ($self) = @_;
    my $drive  = $self->drive;
    my @params = ('id=' . $drive->node_name,
        "if=pflash",
        'file=' . $drive->file);

    $self->_push_ifdef(\@params, 'unit=',     $self->unit);
    $self->_push_ifdef(\@params, 'readonly=', $self->readonly);

    return ('-drive', join(',', @params));
