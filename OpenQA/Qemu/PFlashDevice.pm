=head3 OpenQA::Qemu::PFlashDevice

Some storage devices can only be created using the '-drive' parameter in
QEMU. Pflash is one such device (at the time of writing), so we can not use a
standard drive device to represent it. This limits our control over how the
drive device and block device chain are created; we can not set the node id of
the top block device for example nor can we override the backing file AFAIK.

This class is the same as DriveDevice except for a few extra fields and
gen_cmdline has been overridden to use '-drive' instead.
