=head3 OpenQA::Qemu::SnapshotConf

Modify and query our snapshot model. Note that adding or reverting to a
snapshot here needs to be combined with calls to BlockDevConf and QEMU itself
to actually perform the snapshot operations and keep the entire object model
consistent. This is done by the Proc class.
